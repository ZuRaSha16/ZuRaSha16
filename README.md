## Hello, My Name's Zurab!  

### üñ•Ô∏è Full Stack Developer
### I am a Computer Science student passionate about web development. Two years ago, I began my journey by learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I deepened my understanding of JavaScript, I explored TypeScript and its powerful features. Over time, I mastered modern frameworks like React.js and Next.js, which allowed me to build interactive and scalable web applications. Later, I expanded into backend development with Node.js, further strengthening my full-stack development skills.

I specialize in creating dynamic, user-friendly websites and applications by exploring both front-end and back-end technologies. My journey involves mastering modern frameworks, optimizing performance, and creating seamless user experiences. Through hands-on projects, I continuously refine my skills, aiming to become a proficient full-stack developer.
