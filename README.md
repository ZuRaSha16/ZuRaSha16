## Hello, My Name's Zurab!  

### 🖥️ Full Stack Developer
### Two years ago, I started my journey by learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I delved deeper into JavaScript, I explored TypeScript and its powerful features. Over time, I mastered modern frameworks like React.js and Next.js, enabling me to build interactive, scalable web applications. Later, I expanded into backend development with Node.js, further strengthening my full-stack development expertise.

### Today, as a Computer Science student passionate about web development, I specialize in creating dynamic, user-friendly websites and applications. I actively explore both front-end and back-end technologies, focusing on mastering modern frameworks, optimizing performance, and delivering seamless user experiences. Through hands-on projects, I am continuously improving my skills to become a proficient full-stack developer.
