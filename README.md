<h5>
I started my journey by learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I delved deeper into JavaScript, I explored TypeScript and its powerful features. Over time, I mastered modern frameworks like React.js and Next.js, enabling me to build interactive, scalable web applications. Later, I expanded into backend development with Node.js, further strengthening my full-stack development expertise.
